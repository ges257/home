## Hi, I'm Greg.

### High-Velocity Architect | Research-to-Production Cycle Compressor | AI Engineer

I build the systems that *should* exist but don't.

Most engineers optimize for writing code. I optimize for **validating architectural bets.** My process is simple but aggressive: I deeply synthesize research, make high-conviction directional calls, and execute rapidly to prove them in production. I don't wait for the "perfect" tool—I identify the gap, architect the solution, and ship it.

I achieve this velocity by aggressively embracing **AI and ML-accelerated workflows**. I don't just use these tools to write boilerplate; I use them to **scale my creative ambition.** But my speed isn't just about tooling—it's about **Theoretical Mastery.**

**With an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence, I understand the science of AI.** Because I grasp the mathematical foundations and operational limits across the field, I can push individual tools to their theoretical limits or orchestrate them together to extract performance standard implementations leave on the table.

This allows me to operate with the **rigor of a research lab** (because I know the math) and the **speed of a founder** (because I know the tools).

---

## The Three Things I Bring

I bring three capabilities to the table that are rare in combination:

1. **I Know the Science.** AI isn't a single tool—it's a workshop full of tools drawing from a multitude of sciences—and I can orchestrate them to solve real problems.

2. **I Act as a Truth Filter.** The market is flooded with hype. Because I understand the science, I can tell you exactly which tools are empty sales pitches and which ones can actually drive margin for your business.

3. **I Execute Fast.** Once we identify a real opportunity, I use my 'Cycle Compression' methodology to build the solution immediately. I don't need a massive team to test an idea; I use AI acceleration to prototype and ship custom architectures in days.

**You get the Safety of a scientist who knows the limits, and the Speed of a founder who builds the solution.**

## The Intersection of Tech & Business

With years of experience as an employee, entrepreneur, and business owner—combined with a **Cornell MBA focused on Digital Transformation and Frontier Tech Integration**—I bring deep, real-world context to the challenge of building valuable AI solutions.

I possess the strategic clarity to identify key business challenges through consultative analysis with leaders, decide exactly **if** and **where** AI creates value, and communicate technical concepts effectively to non-technical stakeholders.

---

## The Mechanism: Theory → Synthesis → Execution

I don't rely on "gut feel." My technical taste is derived from a **First-Principles understanding of the technology.** I read the literature, understand the mathematical limits, and build the solution before the market catches up.

| The Thesis | The Build |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"LLMs are powerful but mathematically context-blind."** | **[Memory Socket](https://github.com/ges257/memory-socket)** — Leveraged deep understanding of transformer attention limits to architect a universal "USB for Neural Inference" storage interface. |
| **"Vendor consolidation is a graph topology problem, not a semantic search problem."** | **[PE-Rollup-GNN](https://github.com/ges257/pe-rollup-gnn)** — Engineered a Text-to-KG pipeline + R-GCN architecture that achieved **0.94 PR-AUC** by encoding causal logic directly into the graph. |
| **"Financial audits require symbolic certainty, not probabilistic guessing."** | **[CIRA Audit System](https://github.com/ges257/cira-audit)** — Designed a neuro-symbolic framework that fused LLM flexibility with formal logic, saving a firm from bankruptcy. |

## What I Do

* **First-Principles Exploitation:** I don't just use APIs; I exploit the underlying mechanics of the models. I know what the math allows, so I build what others think is impossible.
* **Cycle Compression:** I combine this theoretical depth with AI-accelerated workflows to move from "Paper Read" to "Prototype Shipped" in days.
* **End-to-End Architecture:** I own the stack—from the NeurIPS-level theory to the React frontend.

## How I Work: Three Engagement Models

My skillset allows me to deliver value across three engagement types, depending on your organization's needs:

### As a Contractor (Project-Based Execution)

I parachute into a specific problem and build the solution end-to-end. You get a shipped system in weeks, not quarters, with no infrastructure drag.

### As a Consultant (Strategic Guidance)

I act as your **Technical Reality Officer** during AI adoption—filtering hype, reviewing architectures, and preventing expensive failures before you invest.

### As an Employee (Strategic Build + Scale)

I join as a **High-Velocity Architect** who ships novel systems while establishing "Cycle Compression" as a repeatable methodology within your team.
